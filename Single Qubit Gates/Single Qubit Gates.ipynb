    "\n",
    "Firstly, Wave functions are **complex valued** meaning they don't just give you some real number that directly corresponds to the physical world. Instead, it gives you a complex number which, after further manipulation, will give you the *probability* or *probability density* of an observable having a certain value. \n",
    "\n",

    "## Vector Space and Hilbert Space\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last meeting, I also briefly went over what **Hilbert Space** and **Vector Space** were. \n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of vector spaces is incredibly powerful because as we long as we can define stuff to satisfy the set of rules of a vector space needs, we can use linear algebra to handle complex things like wave functions and quantum states!\n",
    "\n",
    "I wanted to give a more formal introduction here just to help solidify your understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "A vector space is a collection, $V$ of vectors and two operators ($+$ and $\\cdot$) such that a set of rules holds for them.\n",

    "\n",
    "Adding two vectors in the set of vectors $V$ should produce another vector that is in $V$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The powerful thing about vector spaces is that the \"vectors\" don't have to just be the vectors we're familiar with in Geometry and Physics. Vectors include things like polynomials, matrices, etc. __ANY SET OF THINGS__ that can satisfy a set of base rules constitute a vector space.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hilbert Space** is a kind of **Vector Space** that has the same base rules as any **Vector Space** but adds some rules that line up with a lot of the \"quirks\" of Quantum Mechanics (like normalizing the wave function.)\n",

    "**Hilbert Space** itself is split into two other variations, **Finite Dimensional Hilbert Space** and **Infinite Dimensional Hilbert Space**.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Vector space of complex-valued functions (sound familiar?)\n",
    "2. We have an infinite number of basis elements to create other elements from\n",
    "3. All functions are **square integrable**\n",
    "\n",
    "The second point seems a little odd but basically, we're familiar of the idea of using a set of vectors (basis vectors) capable of making every other vector. In Infinite Dimensional Hilbert Space, we're given an infinite number of basis functions (remember, vector spaces can be defined for anything that follows the rules) to make other functions from.

    "\n",
    "Qubits are actually represented as a *linear combination* of two basis vectors. The vectors are unit (length 1) and orthogonal (perpendicular) to each other. Remember though, that the two basis vectors could easily be two other wave functions and that the qubit __ITSELF__ is described by a wave function!\n",

    "and $a$ and $b$ must satisfy the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\left| a \\right|^2 + \\left| b \\right|^2 = 1 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This seemingly innocent mathematical expression already shows the qubit's ability for *superposition*, the ability to be in multiple states (in this case, some combination of the 0 and 1 kets) at once as we manipulate the probability the qubit will \"collapse\" into $\\ket{0}$ or $\\ket{1}$ upon measurement. You can think of $\\ket{0}$ and $\\ket{1}$ as the analogues to our digital 1's and 0's.\n",
